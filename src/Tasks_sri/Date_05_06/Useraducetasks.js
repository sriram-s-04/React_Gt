{/* Form Input State Management

Goal: Efficiently manage the state of multiple form input fields using `useReducer`.

Description:
This task involves building a form with several input fields (e.g., name, email, password, and age). Instead of using separate `useState` hooks for each input, you will use a single `useReducer` to manage the state of all fields in a centralized and scalable way.

Each input field will:

* Update the state when the user types.
* Be controlled by the reducer function, which updates the corresponding field based on the action.
 */}



{/* Cart Management (Add, Remove, Update Quantity)

Goal: Implement a simple shopping cart where users can:

Add items: Users can add new items to the cart.
Remove items: Users can remove items from the cart.
Update quantity: Users can update the quantity of existing items in the cart.
and display the total price. */}


{/* Form with Dynamic Fields (Add More Inputs)

Goal: Create a form where users can dynamically add multiple entries. The form should allow:

* Adding new fields (e.g., name and age).
* Removing fields when not needed.
* Managing each field's state separately.
